## Monitor Dynamic IP Address

### Description

I have a website that runs off a dynamic ip address. Using ZoneEdit and DynamicUpdate I can publish my IP address to my DNS sever when ever it changes, but DynamicUpdate does not do a very good job of telling me when this happens, so I created a little app that will allow you to input one or more servers to monitor the IP address. The application can display a notification window, play a sound, send an email, and update your HOSTS file if you choose to.

This application shows how to get the IP address of a web server, send a SMTP email, play a sound, write to an INI file, minimize to the tray (I did not write that code), and general all purpose object oriented techniques.

Please take a look at the code and if you like it give me those 5 beautiful globes!
